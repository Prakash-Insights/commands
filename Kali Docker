Kali Linux

I went to a talk recently on security. Kali Linux was mentioned and I started looking at what this meant.

I was thinking of setting up a machine to explore when a co-worker mentioned building a Docker Container with Kali Linux inside it. With some quick searching I found that they already had Kali Linux dockerized ... I settled on the "ROLLING" version.

THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR MYSELF.

Here are the abbreviated notes I put together ...
From ... Kali Containers Docker
Docker Installation and Update

$ docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling

$ docker run -ti --rm -v /Users/bob.fornal/Projects/pentest/root:/root -v /Users/bob.fornal/Projects/pentest/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash


$ docker run -ti --rm  kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash



# apt-get update && apt-get install metasploit-framework

The steps from this point forward should be re-run each time you start Kali Linux in this Docker Container (the run command below).

# apt update

# apt upgrade

# apt dist-upgrade

# apt autoremove

# apt clean
Tooling (that I still need to explore in more detail)

# msfconsole
